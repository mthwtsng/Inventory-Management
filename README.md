Cmpt 276 Group Project ideas

Meeting 1  (Feb 2, 2024): 
Ideas: 
App that locates disabled washrooms
App to pay for wishlists for the homeless

Charity: 
ChildHelp 

App for greater van food bank ideas: 
2 options for login: donator or receiver 
Receivers can login and access a “wishlist”

Meeting 2  (Feb 7, 2024): 
Questions: 
How should we verify whether the product is received
What do we do if some items on an order are missing even if it says its complete 
Our app’s logistics: 
We select what products are available to the users, and they can choose what they want 
The donor selects what products they want to purchase/donate, and they are responsible for bringing it into the food bank (no online transaction on our end) 
There is a max number of items for receiver wishlists, since donors have to purchase a whole wishlist 
It would be to expensive for donors if there is an unlimited amount of items on a wishlist 
Plan for next meeting: 
Have the base/idea of the application 
Decide what roles each person will have 
More of how we will make the functions/code




Proposal questions to answer: 
Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?
What is the name of your web application?
Toy inventory (Childhelp)


How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?
The problem our client wants us to solve is by creating an inventory to organize and categorize the clothing and toy donations Childhelp recieves. There are many types of inventories for websites and applications, which typically require a database for data storage such as SQL, Postgre SQL,etc. Our group will be using Postgre SQL to store and organize donations. 

How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?
Our project will be used to improve organization and efficency for the Childhelp organization, since they currently do not have a database or a way of categorizing clothing and toy donations at the moment. This database will categorize toy donations based on genre(ex stuffed animals, action figures, boardgames,etc), recommended age range, quantity, and gender. The clothing donations will be sorted based on gender, age range, and type of clothing(for example shirts, jackets, shoes,etc). There will also be an educational component as well for regular users ( i.e anyone with the link) to view a graphical/chart display of the current inventory and which items are most needed.


Who is the target audience? Who will use your app or play your game?
This web application is designed to be an extension of the existing website for Childhelp, so anyone who is interested in learning more about the company and it's purpose will be able to use the app. The second type of user will be the current employees/volunteers who work in the toy/clothing donation department and will be able to update the inventory. Such users will be able to add or remove items from the inventory when needed.

What is the scope of your project?
Does this project have many individual features or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.
There are two options for viewing the webpage: regular user and registered user. The regular users will only be allowed to view the webpage but will not have access to the database or inventory. They will be able to view the current inventory stock and see the current quantities of the items stored. The registered users will have access to search, add and remove items based on the category. We may also consider adding an admin user who will authorize new users to sign up and be able to access the database. Aside from the database, the website will feature various subcategories such as an about page, a partners and contributors page, stories of those affected by Childhelp, and more which will be further reviewed with the client.


What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user of your site, what types of things can I do?  These are the ‘stories’ of your project.
Scenario 1: Admin
One of the charity workers opens the website. Since he has an account, he selects the login option. He types in a the correct user name and password so he gets redirected to the main page. The charity recently received several toy donations so he selected the add to inventory option on the screen. From there he can enter the toy names, quantity and age range . It then gets added to the data base.


Scenario 2:  
	Some of the toys were recently donated. A charity worker can login to their account using the login page. To delete some of the items from the inventory, they can click the view inventory button and they are presented with a chart or table showing all the current items in stock. Each item has a quantity displayed as well as a plus and minus button. The user can look for which items were deleted and hit the minus button that many times / or we can do a change quantity button where the user manually enters the new quantity. The same applies to the add button, if they want to add more of the same toy. 


Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members
Yes, there is enough work for all of us.
